# Notes-App
This is a notes app using Firebase Firestore

In this app i have learned how to use authentication and firestore feature of firebase.

In the Sign Up Activity when user will sign up a confirmation will be sent to the mail provided by the user when user will verify that mail then only the user will be able to login into the app.

One more professional feature is there that is forgot password activity whenever user will click on forgot password after entering the mail, a mail will be sent to the user's mail to change the password and then the user will be able to login in the app with the changed password.

Now coming to the Main Activity, there you can see that a staggered layout is taken for showing the mail.

Rest of the things you can see in the photos below -
